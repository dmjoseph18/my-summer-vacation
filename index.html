<p> In June a week after school was over, my mom and I travled to Martha's Vineyard, MA. We spent a week there on the island. It was the first time we've been able to return in roughly eight years.</p>

<p>I spent a week of summer 2017 in Anchorage, Alaska on a mission trip, through <a href="https://www.claytonbaptistchurch.com">CBC Missions</a>, sponsored by <a href=http://www.graceworksak.com/">Graceworks</a>. CBC missions refers to Clayton Baptist Church and is located in Clayton, Georgia. This mission trip was my first and extrememly nervewrecking at first; but after having gone, I don't regret a thing about the experience it gave me. I was giving the opportuntity to be a blessing in other peoples lives, as well as exploring areas I never would have previously dreamed of seeing in person.</p>

<h2>Moving...again</h2>

<p> The week after I returned from Alaska, I moved from Clayton, GA to Greenville, SC. It is not the first time my family has moved to a different state.</p>
<p></p>

<h2>My Job</h2>
<p>Between the trips and pretty much when I was hanging out with friends, I worked. I curently work at Chick-fil-a and will be going onto three years in October.<p>
